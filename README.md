### Dependencies:
1. **Apache Commons Math 3.6.1:**
   - Download from: [Apache Commons Math](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/download_math.cgi)
   - Add the JAR file (e.g., `commons-math3-3.6.1.jar`) to your project's classpath.

2. **JAVE (Java Audio Video Encoder):**
   - Download from: [JAVE](https://github.com/a-schild/jave2)
   - Add the JAR file (e.g., `jave-1.0.2.jar`) to your project's classpath.

3. **Java Swing (for GUI components):**
   - Included in standard Java libraries, no additional setup needed.
 
3. **JOCL (Java bindings for OpenCL):**
   - Download JOCL from the official JOCL GitHub repository: JOCL GitHub Releases
   -  Choose the appropriate version (e.g., jocl-2.x.x-all-platforms.7z).
     
4. **SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java)**:
   - slf4j-api-2.0.9.jar
     
5. **JAVA SDK**:
   - JAVA 17 OR LATER
     
### Setup Instructions:

1. **Download and Install Dependencies:**
   - Download Apache Commons Math JAR, JOCL JAR , slf4j JAR and JAVE JAR.
   - Add all JAR files to your project's classpath.

2. **Configure IDE:**
   - If you're using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, ensure that the project is configured to use the downloaded JAR files.

3. **Run the Main Class:**
   - Execute the `main` method in the `DataPreprocessingLibrary` class to run the example code.
   - The code demonstrates how to use the preprocessing library for different data types, including text, image, numerical data, audio, and sensor data.

4. **Provide Input:**
   - The code includes interactions with the user, such as entering text for preprocessing and choosing an image and audio file.
   - Follow the prompts to provide input during the execution of the program.

5. **Check Output:**
   - The program outputs information about processed data, displays images, plays audio, and shows computed results.
   - Examine the console output to see the results of different preprocessing steps.

6. **Adjust Configuration:**
   - The library includes various configurable parameters and options, such as thresholds for outlier filtering and audio processing settings.
   - Adjust these parameters based on your requirements.

7. **Explore Batches:**
   - The code demonstrates how to split data into training and testing subsets and create batches for training.
   - Check the console output to see batches of different data types.

8. **Review Error Handling:**
   - The code includes error handling and logging. Review the logs and console output for any error messages or warnings.

Note: Ensure that your development environment and runtime environment (JRE) are properly configured with the required dependencies. If using an IDE, follow the specific instructions for adding external JAR files to the classpath.

By following these setup instructions, you should be able to run and explore the provided data preprocessing library.
